In this mind map, we have several categories of data structures, each with several examples listed as bullet points. Here are brief descriptions of each category and example:
Linear: Data structures that store data in a linear sequence.
Array: Stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
Linked List: Stores a collection of elements, each with a reference to the next element in the list.
Stack: Stores a collection of elements, with operations to add and remove elements from the top of the stack.
Queue: Stores a collection of elements, with operations to add elements to the back of the queue and remove elements from the front of the queue.
Tree: Data structures that store data in a hierarchical structure.
Binary Tree: Stores a collection of elements, with each element having at most two children.
Binary Search Tree: A binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
Red-Black Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where each node is colored either red or black, and the root and leaves are black.
B-Tree: A self-balancing tree where each node can have more than two children.
Hash: Data structures that use a hash function to map keys to values.
Hash Table: Stores a collection of key-value pairs, with operations to add, remove, and search for elements based on their keys.
Bloom Filter: A probabilistic data structure that tests whether an element is a member of a set.
Graph: Data structures that store data in a network of nodes and edges.
Directed Graph: A graph where each edge has a direction.
Undirected Graph: A graph where each edge has no direction.
Weighted Graph: A graph where each edge has a weight or cost.
Adjacency Matrix: A matrix that represents a graph, with each row and column representing a node and each cell representing an edge.
Adjacency List: A list that represents a graph, with each element representing a node and a list of adjacent nodes.
Heap: Data structures that store data in a partially ordered binary tree.
Binary Heap: A binary tree where each node has a value greater than or equal to its children.
Min Heap: A binary heap where the root has the minimum value.
Max Heap: A binary heap where the root has the maximum value.
Trie: Data structures that store data in a tree-like structure, where each node represents a prefix of a string.
Prefix Tree: A trie where each node represents a prefix of a string.
Segment Tree: A tree data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments.
Disjoint Set: A data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint subsets.
Fenwick Tree: A data structure used to efficiently update and query prefix sums of a sequence of numbers.

```
In this mind map, we have three main categories of structure: Hierarchical, Network, and Relational. Hierarchical structures are organized in a tree-like structure, with a single parent node and multiple child nodes. Network structures are organized in a graph-like structure, with multiple nodes and edges connecting them. Relational structures are organized in a table-like structure, with rows and columns.
Under each category, we have several examples of structures. Here are brief descriptions of each structure:
Hierarchical Structures:
Tree: A data structure that represents a hierarchical structure with a single root node and multiple child nodes.
File System: A hierarchical structure used to organize files and folders on a computer.
Folder Structure: A hierarchical structure used to organize files and folders in a project or organization.
Network Structures:
Graph: A data structure that represents a network of nodes and edges connecting them.
Web: A network of interconnected web pages and resources.
Client-Server: A network architecture where clients request services from servers.
Relational Structures:
Table: A data structure that represents a collection of related data organized in rows and columns.
Record: A single row in a table that represents a single instance of data.
Column: A single column in a table that represents a single attribute of the data.
Schema: A collection of related tables and their relationships.
Query: A request for data from one or more tables.
Join: A way to combine data from two or more tables based on a common attribute.
Constraint: A rule that restricts the data that can be stored in a table.
Index: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval from a table.
View: A virtual table that is based on the result of a query.
Trigger: A piece of code that is automatically executed in response to a specific event.
Transaction: A sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work.
