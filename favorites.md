[ATAM: Method for Architecture Evaluation.pdf](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/TechnicalReport/2000_005_001_13706.pdf)
```
If a software architecture is a key business asset for an organization, then architectural analysis
must also be a key practice for that organization. Why? Because architectures are complex and
involve many design tradeoffs. Without undertaking a formal analysis process, the organization cannot ensure that the architectural decisions made—particularly those which affect the
achievement of quality attribute such as performance, availability, security, and modifiability—are advisable ones that appropriately mitigate risks. In this report, we will discuss some
of the technical and organizational foundations for performing architectural analysis, and will
present the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis MethodSM (ATAM)—a technique for analyzing
software architectures
